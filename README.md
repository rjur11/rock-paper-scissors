# Rock, Paper, Scissors! Pokémon Edition

## Overview

Rock, Paper, Scissors, but make it Pokémon! Now you can have two of your **favorite** childhood games merged into one. You, a Pokémon trainer, set out to be the very best rock, paper, scissors master. But you can't be a master if you don't practice first! This application will allow you to go head-to-head with your rival in two different game modes- *Classic*, and *Hard*, in order to train your skills. 

**Classic Mode** is your typical Rock, Paper, Scissors set-up. You have three choices, Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle. Now, you already know this, but Bulbasaur beats Squirtle, Squirtle beats Charmander, and Charmander beats Bulbasaur. Select the Pokémon you want to fight with, and the computer will make its own selection. The winner will be decided after a head to head battle! The winner will receive 1 point! But don't forget, if you both pick the same Pokémon, neither of you gets a point. Keep training and racking up those points until you feel ready to switch to hard mode... 

**Hard Mode** brings in two more Pokémon- Pikachu and Sandshrew. The rules get a bit more complicated- Bulbasaur beats Squirtle and Sandshrew, Squirtle beats Charmander and Sandshrew, Charmander beats Bulbasaur, Pikachu beats Squirtle, and Sandshrew beats Pikachu and Charmander. This one won't be easy, but nobody promised the journey to Pokémon Master would be!
