# Rock, Paper, Scissors! Pokemon Edition

## Overview

Rock, Paper, Scissors, but make it Pokemon! Now you can have two of your **favorite** childhood games merged into one. You, a pokemon trainer, set out to be the very best rock, paper, scissors master. But you can't be a master if you don't practice first! This application will allow you to go head-to-head with your rival in two different game modes- *Classic*, and *Hard*, in order to train your skills. 

Classic Mode is your typical Rock, Paper, Scissors set-up. You have three choices, Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle. Now, you already know this, but Bulbasaur beats Squirtle, Squirtle beats Charmander, and Charmander beats Bulbasaur. 

Hard Mode brings in two more pokemon- Pikachu and Sandshrew. The rules get a bit more complicated- Bulbasaur beats Squirtle and Sandshrew, Squirtle beats Charmander and Sandshrew, Charmander beats Bulbasaur, Pikachu beats Squirtle, and Sandshrew beats Pikachu and Charmander. This one won't be easy, but the journey to Pokemon Master didn't promise to be easy!
